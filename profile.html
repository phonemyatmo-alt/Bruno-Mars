    <h2>PROFILE</h2>

    <p>
        Born in Hawaii, Bruno Mars moved to Los Angeles after graduating from high school and formed the production team, The Smeezingtons. 
        He became well-known after producing Flo Rida's <em>Right Round</em> (No.1 in the US) in 2009. 
        In 2010, he appeared as a singer on B.o.B’s <em>Nothin’ on You</em> (No.1) and Travie McCoy’s <em>Billionaire</em> (No.4).
    </p>

    <p>
        In October 2010, he released his first album, <em>Doo-Wops & Hooligans</em>, which included global hits such as 
        <em>Just the Way You Are</em>, <em>Grenade</em>, and <em>The Lazy Song</em>. 
        The album’s success brought him six Grammy nominations and his first win for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        His second album, <em>Unorthodox Jukebox</em> (2012), featured hits like <em>Locked Out of Heaven</em> and 
        <em>When I Was Your Man</em>, giving him five U.S. number-one singles in just three years—a feat not seen since Elvis Presley. 
        In 2014, he headlined the Super Bowl halftime show, achieving record-breaking viewership.
    </p>

        In 2016, Bruno released his third album, <em>24K Magic</em>, producing hits such as <em>That’s What I Like</em> and 
        <em>Finesse</em>. The album won six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. 
        He later performed at the 2016 Super Bowl with Coldplay and Beyoncé, once again setting records.

        In 2021, Bruno formed <strong>Silk Sonic</strong> with Anderson .Paak. Their debut single, 
        <em>Leave the Door Open</em>, topped the Billboard Hot 100 and won multiple Grammy Awards, further cementing 
        Bruno Mars as one of the most influential artists of his generation.
